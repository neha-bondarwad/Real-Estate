# Real-Estate

Real estate firms need to be consistent in their pricing in order to attract buyers. Having a predictive model for the same will be great tool to have, which in turn can also be used to tweak development of properties, putting more emphasis on qualities which increase the value of the property.

**Problem Statement:**

For the given datasets build predictive model for response variable “Price”.
Test data contains all other factors except “Price”, we need to predict that using the model that developed by us and submit predicted values in a csv files.

**Solution: **

•	For the given train and test dataset data pre-processing is done.
•	Imputing of the NA values are done with mean in the dataset.
•	Built the model using random forest algorithm and predicted the values of “Price” column.
•	The accuracy of the model came to **75%.**
•	Output of a model is csv file containing predicted values of “Price” column.
